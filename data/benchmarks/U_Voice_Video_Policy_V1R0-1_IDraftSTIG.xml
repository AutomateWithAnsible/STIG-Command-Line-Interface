      <title>In addition to a general access control policy, the organization must develop and document a specific Voice Video access control policy for dial plans, session control, and remote access that addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;The Voice Video access control policy addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance. It also contains procedures to facilitate the implementation of the access control policy and associated controls.

The access control policy can be one document or several documents, broken down by technology or information system type (e.g., a separate operating system and database access control policy document). Breaking the document into components may help with targeted dissemination and simplify making updates. The policy documents the security requirements and configuration. The policy must reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance (e.g., DISA STIGs, FIPS, and NIST SP 800-53).

Developing and documenting the Voice Video access control policy addressing dial plans, session control, and remote access augments the organization plan, ensuring consistent policies are applied regardless of vendor or platform deployed. A consistently applied policy also helps mitigate the risk from weaker Voice Video system implementations presenting possible attack vectors for the enterprise.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

      <title>The organization must document procedures of the Voice Video access control policy for the configuration and display of endpoint password/PIN.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;During Voice Video endpoint registration with the session controller, a file containing specific configuration settings is downloaded by the endpoint from the session manager. This file contains the phone number assigned to the endpoint, the IP addresses for session management, the software menus specific to the system, the endpoint configuration password, the stored personal preferences and speed dial numbers, and other system operational information. These configuration settings can be updated by resetting and re-registering the endpoint, which causes an updated configuration file to be downloaded.

The network configuration information and settings on a Voice Video hardware endpoint must be protected by a password or PIN. Voice Video endpoints do not typically provide automated PIN/password management. PINs that are not managed or required to be changed are most likely never changed; therefore, they are easily compromised or guessed. Additionally, as SA personnel change, the group passwords and PINs they know and use must be changed. Therefore, the organization must have and follow a policy and procedure for managing the passwords or PINs used to access the local VoIP phone network configurations. Such a standard operating procedure should address password/PIN complexity (length and character mix), expiration, change intervals, other conditions requiring a change, reuse, protection, and storage.

NOTE: Most instruments will only accept numerical input; therefore, a PIN is used. Some instruments may accept alpha characters for passwords. These factors help determine the password/PIN complexity that is achievable.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Registration authenticates and authorizes Voice Video endpoints with the registration server, which is usually a function of the session manager.

For most Voice Video systems (VoIP), registration is the process of centrally recording the user ID, endpoint MAC address, and service/policy profile with two-stage authentication prior to authorizing the establishment of the session and user service. The event of successful registration creates the session record immediately. Video conferencing systems register using a similar process with a gatekeeper.

If the Voice Video registration policy does not include the architecture used for registration, the supporting network services and protocols, boundary protection, and authorized registration servers (other than session managers) to register Voice Video endpoints, this is a finding.</check-content>

      <title>The organization must document the Voice Video VLAN Access Control List (ACL) design controlling Voice Video system access and traffic flow.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Information flow control regulates where information is allowed to travel within a network and between interconnected networks. The flow of all network traffic must be monitored and controlled so it does not introduce any unacceptable risk to the network infrastructure or data.

The use of ACLs on LAN routers and switches manages the flow of media and signaling traffic between Voice Video VLANs and subnets. The VLANs are defined as follows:

- Hardware Voice Video endpoints: VLANs normally in parallel with data LAN VLANs
- Software Unified Capability (UC) and Video Conferencing (VC) soft clients on workstations: VLANs normally in parallel with data LAN VLANs
- Voice Video core equipment consisting of session managers, soft switches, registration authentication server, and network services: single VLAN
- Voice Video border equipment consisting of media gateways (MG), signaling gateways (SG), and session border controllers (SBC): single VLAN
- Voice Video system management: management VLAN (can be combined with other LAN management VLAN)
- Voicemail, UC services servers, and UC web servers: accessible to Voice Video and data VLANs

The VLANs and associated ACLs for the Voice Video system must segregate from the other VLANs. The ACL design may change depending on the location and makeup of the Voice Video equipment. For instance, an MG and SG residing on the same platform use the same Ethernet LAN connection and do not need separate VLANs, but the ACL may need to be adjusted accordingly. In general, the defined ACLs are deny-by-default, limiting protocols and traffic to only those specifically allowed.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Information flow control regulates where information is allowed to travel within a network and between interconnected networks. The flow of all network traffic must be monitored and controlled so it does not introduce any unacceptable risk to the network infrastructure or data. 

For Voice Video systems, the enclave boundary protection may be inadequate if not specifically designed to process Voice Video signaling and media. The standard firewall used to protect an enclave supporting data traffic is not capable of properly handling or supporting Voice Video communications. A Voice Video stateful firewall or session border controller (SBC), in parallel with the data firewall, provides the best protection for the enclave.

Dynamically opening required UDP ports to permit the flow of the media, performing stateful inspection of UDP media packets and dropping all non-session packets, and then closing the UDP ports at the session's end or after an inactivity timeout greatly increases enclave protection. This configuration provides the capability to decrypt the media streams for inspection and recording. This supports, for purposes of the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), the monitoring and recording of calls that traverse the enclave boundary.

When a Voice Video system is a closed system, such as DISN classified networks, the entire address space of the WAN and connected enclaves is managed by a single system manager. A specific limited and segregated address space may be assigned for all Voice Video devices in use across the network. The risk to the enclave is limited when a standard firewall is used with inbound permit statements that are based on the segregated IP address range. When Network Address Translation (NAT) is used, the Voice Video stateful firewall or SBC provides RFC 1918 internal private addressing, allowing packets to traverse the boundary. Although NAT is no longer required to be implemented, it is still a common security best practice.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

Ensure the enclave boundary protection is designed and implemented to protect the Voice Video infrastructure and the data enclave.

The data firewall function must protect the Voice Video sub-enclave and infrastructure by:

1. Blocking all Voice Video traffic to/from the Voice Video production VLANs, except for signaling and media traffic to/from a remote endpoint entering the enclave via a properly authenticated and encrypted tunnel, where Voice Video traffic is blocked from data VLANs.
2. Blocking all non-Voice Video traffic to/from the Voice Video production VLANs. 
3. Blocking all non-Voice Video traffic to/from the Voice Video management VLANs, except for Voice Video system management traffic to/from specifically authorized management servers and workstations (local or in a remote NOC).

3. Supporting interoperability and Assured Service requirements per the DoD UCR.

When PSTN ISDN or circuit-switched commercial service connects to the enclave, the connection must be through a media gateway function to protect the Voice Video sub-enclave and infrastructure.

NOTES:
1. A PSTN media gateway connection is not required when the site is approved for a commercial IP service connection. 
2.

The enclave must be a closed DISN classified network or an organizational intranet, the PMO must designate and implement a segregated IP address range for use by the Voice Video system, and no dedicated Voice Video firewall function (as defined in the current Unified Capabilities Requirements [UCR]) is implemented to meet this exception.

Review the Voice Video system design documents. Visually inspect the enclave boundary protection hardware and connections to verify the implementation is as documented in the design. Interview the ISSO to confirm compliance.

2. Inspecting all Voice Video traffic to/from the Voice Video production VLANs.
3. Supporting interoperability and Assured Service requirements per the DoD UCR.

When PSTN commercial service connects to the enclave, the connection must be through a media gateway function to protect the Voice Video sub-enclave and infrastructure.

      <title>The organization must document remote access to the Voice Video system.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Remote access is connection to organizational information systems by users communicating through external networks (e.g., the Internet). Organizations often employ encrypted virtual private networks (VPNs) to enhance confidentiality and integrity over remote connections. The use of encrypted VPNs does not make the access non-remote; however, the use of VPNs, when adequately provisioned with appropriate security controls (e.g., employing appropriate encryption techniques for confidentiality and integrity protection) may provide sufficient assurance to the organization that it can effectively treat such connections as internal networks.

Still, VPN connections traverse external networks, and the encrypted VPN does not enhance the availability of remote connections. Also, VPNs with encrypted tunnels can affect the organizational capability to adequately monitor network communications traffic for malicious code.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

      <title>The organization must implement and document the Session Border Controller (SBC) used to protect unclassified Voice Video systems connecting to an external network.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Organizations must carefully consider the risks that may be introduced when information systems (i.e., system interconnections) are connected to other systems with different security requirements and security controls, both within organizations and external to organizations. Authorizing Officials must determine the risk associated with information system connections and the appropriate controls employed. Risk considerations also include information systems sharing the same networks. 

Organizations typically do not have control over external networks (e.g., the Internet). Approved boundary protection devices (e.g., routers, firewalls, border controllers) mediate communications (i.e., information flows) between unclassified national security systems and external networks. Boundary protection is required for processing, storing, or transmitting all Voice Video media and signaling. For Voice Video, connection of unclassified systems to external systems requires an SBC to protect media and signaling traffic. Between the external network and the SBC, a boundary routing device, typically the Customer Edge (CE) router, must ensure all Voice Video media and signaling traffic is directed to the SBC.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Organizations must carefully consider the risks that may be introduced when information systems (i.e., system interconnections) are connected to other systems with different security requirements and security controls, both within organizations and external to organizations. Authorizing Officials must determine the risk associated with information system connections and the appropriate controls employed. Risk considerations also include information systems sharing the same networks. 

For Voice Video systems, the enclave boundary protection may be inadequate if not specifically designed to process Voice Video signaling and media. The standard firewall used to protect an enclave supporting data traffic is not capable of properly handling or supporting Voice Video communications. A Voice Video stateful firewall or SBC, in parallel with the data firewall, provides the best protection for the enclave. Dynamically opening required UDP ports to permit the flow of the media, performing stateful inspection of UDP media packets and dropping all non-session packets, and then closing the UDP ports at the session's end or after an inactivity timeout greatly increases enclave protection. This configuration provides the capability to decrypt the media streams for inspection and recording. This supports, for purposes of the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), the monitoring and recording of calls that traverse the enclave boundary.

When a Voice Video system is a closed system, such as DISN classified networks, the entire address space of the WAN and connected enclaves is managed by a single system manager. A specific limited and segregated address space may be assigned for all Voice Video devices in use across the network. The risk to the enclave is limited when a standard firewall is used with inbound permit statements that are based on the segregated IP address range. When NAT is used, the Voice Video stateful firewall or SBC provides RFC 1918 internal private addressing, allowing packets to traverse the boundary. Although NAT is no longer required to be implemented, it is still a common security best practice.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

Confirm the organization performs and documents network vulnerability scans at the bidirectional enclave boundary protection used between the local Voice Video system management network and the DISN Voice Services management network.

Verify the effectiveness of the boundary protection ACLs by performing network vulnerability scans as follows:

- Scan the entire DISN management network (e.g., RTS EMS, ADIMSS, ARDIMSS, or DCN) address space from an unused randomly selected IP address on the local management network.
- Scan the entire local management network address space from an unused randomly selected IP address on the DISN management network.

If the organization does not perform and document scans at the bidirectional enclave boundary protection used between the local Voice Video system management network and the DISN Voice Services management network, this is a finding.

If the network vulnerability scan receives a response from any host on either network, this is a finding.</check-content>

      <title>The organization must comply with DoDI 8551.01 for functions, ports, protocols, and services.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Information systems provide a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions). Organizations review functions and services provided by information systems or individual components of information systems to determine which functions and services are candidates for elimination. Organizations can use network scanning tools, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and end-point protections such as firewalls to prevent the use of prohibited functions, ports, protocols, and services.

The organization can either make a determination of the relative security of the function, port, protocol, and/or service or base the security decision on the assessment of other entities. Bluetooth, FTP, and peer-to-peer networking are examples of less-than-secure protocols.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Contingency planning for information systems is part of an overall organizational program for achieving continuity of operations for mission/business functions. Contingency planning addresses both information system restoration and implementation of alternative mission/business processes when systems are compromised. Performing contingency planning on hardware, software, and firmware development can be an effective means of achieving information system resiliency. Contingency plans reflect the degree of restoration required for organizational information systems since not all systems may need to fully recover to achieve the level of continuity of operations desired. 

Capacity planning is needed because different types of threats (e.g., natural disasters, targeted cyber attacks) can result in a reduction of the available processing, telecommunications, and support services originally intended to support the organizational missions/business functions. Organizations may need to anticipate degraded operations during contingency operations and factor such degradation into capacity planning. For Voice Video systems, contingency planning must also consider fire and emergency services (FES) requirements for life safety and Command and Control (C2) requirements mandating communications among top-level officials, especially during crisis conditions.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

Review the contingency plan for the Voice Video system. Confirm the critical network equipment is redundant and in geographically diverse locations. Redundant sets of Customer Edge (CE) routers, session border controllers (SBCs), and session managers must be housed in geographically diverse facilities within the site, so that if one of locations is lost or isolated from the network, communications service is maintained. Sites facilities with a Soft Switch should have a session controller implemented in a geographically diverse location. 

If critical network equipment does not have redundant equipment, this is a finding.

If redundant critical network equipment is not in a geographically diverse location, this is a finding.

If it is determined, following a cost versus benefit study and risk analysis, that redundant facilities containing dual sets of CE routers, SBCs, and session controllers are not warranted for the given site, this requirement should be marked as a finding with a justification included in the Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&amp;M) stating the Authorizing Official is cognizant of and accepts the risk.</check-content>

For Voice Video systems, contingency planning must also consider FES requirements for life safety and Command and Control (C2) requirements mandating communications among top-level officials, especially during crisis conditions.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

Alternate telecommunications services include, for example, additional organizational or commercial ground-based circuits/lines or satellites in lieu of ground-based communications. Organizations consider factors such as availability, quality of service, and access when entering into alternate telecommunications agreements.

Organizations consider the potential mission/business impact in situations where telecommunications service providers are servicing other organizations with similar priority-of-service provisions. For Voice Video systems, contingency planning must also consider fire and emergency services (FES) requirements for life safety and Command and Control (C2) requirements mandating communications among top-level officials, especially during crisis conditions.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

Threats that affect telecommunications services are typically defined in organizational assessments of risk and include, for example, natural disasters, structural failures, hostile cyber/physical attacks, and errors of omission/commission. Organizations seek to reduce common susceptibilities by, for example, minimizing shared infrastructure among telecommunications service providers and achieving sufficient geographic separation between services. Organizations may consider using a single service provider in situations where the service provider can provide alternate telecommunications services meeting the separation needs addressed in the risk assessment.

To provide address segregation, best practices dictate that all like components will be placed in like address ranges. Therefore Voice Video system components (e.g., gatekeepers, session managers, voice mail systems, Voice Video endpoints) must be deployed within their own, separate private IP network, logical sub-network, or networks. The combination of logical data and voice segmentation via addressing and VLANs coupled with a switched and routed infrastructure strongly mitigates call eavesdropping and other attacks. Segregating data from telephony by placing Voice Video servers and endpoints on logically separate IP networks while controlling access to these components through IP filters will help to ensure security and aid in protecting the Voice Video environment.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

The SIPRNet PMO designates specific IP address ranges for use by the DISN VoSIP service and assigns them to the VoSIP PMO for VoSIP address management and assignment. The VoSIP service provides VoIP-based communications between VoIP systems within the customer's classified LANs operating at the secret level while using the SIPRNet WAN for the inter-enclave transport. The SIPRNet PMO requires network-wide IP address accountability or traceability based on assigned IP address. SIPRNet-connected secret LANs use IP addresses assigned by the SIPRNet PMO. Therefore, customers of the DISN VoSIP service must use IP addresses assigned to them by the VoSIP PMO for Voice Video session manager, session border controllers, and endpoints within their LANs.

If a VoIP communications system operated on a secret LAN does not use the worldwide DISN VoSIP service, communicate with other enclaves that use the DISN VoSIP service, or have any access to the DRSN, this is not applicable. Voice Video systems implemented in this manner must use their own dedicated IP address space carved out of the address space assigned to their LAN by the SIPRNet PMO.

Different DHCP scopes contain different IP address space, subnets, and VLANs. When using DHCP for address assignment and host configuration, unique DHCP scopes must be used for voice components and data components. Providing a DHCP server dedicated to Voice Video endpoints is the most direct means, serving Voice Video devices in the Voice Video domain using the same address space and VLANs. This prevents routing DHCP requests through the data environment, which degrades the separation of the Voice Video environment from the data environment.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

      <fixtext fixref="F-VVSP-01-000095_fix">Document in each Voice Video SSP the organizations implementation of a dedicated DHCP server scope to the Voice Video system within the LAN. The Voice Video system design must use DHCP for initial endpoint address assignment/configuration. Best practice is to use a separate DHCP server from any data components/hosts and reside in the respective Voice Video or data address space and VLAN.

Unified Capability (UC) soft clients or applications residing on a PC/workstations will, by default, derive IP information obtained by the workstation from the data DHCP server. When the workstation is capable of multiple VLANs, the UC soft client must be assigned to the Voice Video VLAN, receiving IP information from the Voice Video DHCP server for use by UC soft clients or applications.

Best practice is for the Voice Video DHCP server be implemented in the following order of preference: as a dedicated device, part of the Voice Video session manager, part of another Voice Video related server, or on an infrastructure router (not perimeter) inside the enclave supporting the Voice Video system or VLANs. Using a single DHCP server, separated through VLANs, to serve both voice and data endpoints is allowed as long as the voice and data endpoints are restricted by ACLs from communicating with each other.</fixtext>

NOTE: A related best practice to support FES is a procedure for unassigned phone numbers. Confirm that the phone number's unassignment procedure includes reducing the class of service to limited use, to ensure FES is available. An available working phone must be reachable in workspaces at all times. Leaving non-working phones on desks can cause confusion, resulting in death or injury, during emergency situations.</check-content>

      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Power systems rely on multiple tiers of defense for providing continuous power to sites and systems. Commercial power may be supplemented by uninterruptible power systems (UPS), generators, or other means. Power must be distributed to the network infrastructure, endpoints, servers, and other network devices to ensure constant delivery of services. Voice Video systems must be designed and implemented to ensure fire and emergency services (FES) are always available.

Voice Video endpoint users require different levels of capability depending on DISN Voice Precedence needs. Flash/Flash Override users must have eight hours of continuous backup power at all times. Immediate/Priority users must have two hours of continuous backup power. Routine and lower users do not require backup power, except to provide necessary FES. The UPS must provide power for the LAN infrastructure, WAN boundary, Voice Video infrastructure, and Voice Video endpoints.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

The organization must also ensure the Voice Video system provides 99.997 percent availability.

The UPS system must support all Immediate/Priority users in all parts of the network design as follows:

- All Voice Video system components, including portions of the LAN directly supporting these users, are provided with a minimum of two hours of UPS.
- All Immediate/Priority user Voice Video endpoints relying on Power over Ethernet (PoE) must have power sourcing equipment sized to support the asset and endpoints by the UPS for two hours.
- All Immediate/Priority user Voice Video endpoints without PoE must be provided with a minimum of two hours of UPS.
- All Voice Video system components must have minimal environmental power (HVAC) to prevent equipment failures for two hours.
- All UPS units will be sized and maintained to prevent power loss or drop to the supported equipment when primary power is removed.</fixtext>

For Voice Video systems, the unclassified phone system typically also performs as an emergency contact system. Callers may need to report conditions for fire and emergency services (FES). Additionally, mission-critical decision-making users may need to initiate or receive high-priority calls for dissemination of crisis information using the DISN Voice Precedence services. Users must be trained to know and practice correct handling of these calls and must sign agreements prior to use. Other Voice Video systems, such as video conferencing and classified systems, may warrant additional user training and agreements.

Additional issues may result from using UC soft clients for mission-critical communications. Users must be aware of these limitations and may require backup or parallel communications capability.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

The traditional circuit-switched telecommunications network is highly available and reliable, with 99.999 percent uptime for equipment and 99 percent to 99.9 percent for the entire system. This is achieved through a series of measures such as redundant hardware and network connectivity and backup power for the central switching equipment, which also provides power for the subscriber instruments. The DoD circuit-switched telecommunications network supports routine communications, emergency communications, and high-priority military Command and Control precedence. As these services migrate from circuit-switched technologies to IP-based technologies, this reliability and support must migrate with the service. Similar measures enhance the reliability and availability of Voice Video services on an IP network.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

      <title>The organizational Voice Video security architecture must restrict Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) and H.248 (MEGACO) to Voice Video VLANs on local networks and encrypted VPNs.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;The information security architecture at the individual information system level must be consistent with and complement the more global, organization-wide information security architecture that is integral to and developed as part of the enterprise architecture.

MGCP is used between Media Gateway Controllers (MGCs), Media Gateways (MGs), and other MGs to exchange sensitive gateway status and zone information and establish sessions via the MG. MGCP is a clear-text, human-readable protocol. This information is critical in the setup and completion of voice calls from one VoIP zone to another VoIP zone or, more typically, from a VoIP zone to a TDM zone. If this information is poisoned or collected and used by an unauthorized, unscrupulous individual, the effects to the VoIP environment could be detrimental. Denial of service or fraudulent system use are only two of the potential compromises. Therefore, MGCP messages must be protected from eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle, and replay attacks. To protect MGCP, Request for Comment (RFC) 2705, which defines MGCP, outlines and recommends the use of IPsec for encryption and authentication between gateways. This recommendation primarily applies to the use of MGCP across unprotected WANs such as the Internet. This extends to use on NIPRNet as well. A follow-on protocol defined jointly by the IETF in RFC 3435 and the ITU-T in Recommendation H.248.1 is MEGACO/H.248, which provides the same general functionality as MGCP. RFC 3435 also requires that H.248 packets be authenticated and/or encrypted using IPsec. Unfortunately, there is not widespread support by MGCs and MGs for IPsec protection, and therefore reliance is on external IPsec VPNs when traversing the WAN. When confined within the LAN, MGCP can be protected in a number of ways without IPsec.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

      <title>A Call Center or Computer Telephony Integration (CTI) system using soft clients must be segregated into a protected enclave and limit traffic traversing the boundary.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;The information security architecture at the individual information system level must be consistent with and complement the more global, organization-wide information security architecture that is integral to and developed as part of the enterprise architecture. The information security architecture includes an architectural description, the placement/allocation of security functionality (including security controls), security-related information for external interfaces, information being exchanged across the interfaces, and the protection mechanisms associated with each interface.

UC soft clients may be used on a strategic LAN when associated with or part of a CTI application. Traditional computer telephony integration CTI encompasses the control of a telephone or telecommunications switch by a computer application. Interfaces have been developed to provide connection between the computer, typically a workstation, and the telephone or other terminal attached to the telephone switch, and possibly a special analog or TDM line going directly to the telephone switch.

Applications are also developed to use these interfaces to integrate a data application with the telephone system. Sometimes the integration is as simple as being able to dial a number from the computer application, or it could provide full control of the switch as in the case of an operator's console. In these traditional scenarios, the voice stayed in a traditional telephone set and the data stayed on the computer with the exception of the control information. If the voice does enter the computer, it is sent directly to the sound card or converted to a sound file for storage and possible file transfer. The voice communication is not transmitted in real time via IP protocols. In contrast, modern-day CTI is changing in that today the voice communications and control is being transmitted using IP protocols and the hardware interfaces and telephones are being replaced by computer applications. 

NOTE: The CTI systems discussed here are not unified communications applications, although some of the features are similar. CTI systems generally have a special function and are not a general user application. These are typically Call Center or Help Desk applications. This type of CTI typically involves integration with a database application. In this scenario, where soft-phones are an integral part of the CTI system/application, implementation of separate voice and data zones could be detrimental to the proper functioning of the application. While separation requirements should be enforced if possible, they could be relaxed providing the general CTI requirement of treating the CTI system as an enclave is followed. A system such as this should have its own VoIP controller. If the system needs to communicate with systems outside the CTI system enclave, proper boundary protection must be provided. For example, since IP soft-phones are prevalent in today's Call Center/Help Desk systems, such a system would require the ability to place and receive phone calls from outside the CTI enclave. Calls might leave and enter the enclave via VoIP or a TDM media gateway.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

When a Call Center/CTI system/application (e.g., Call Center, Help Desk, operators console, E911 system, etc.) using soft clients is approved for use in the strategic LAN, ensure the following:

- The supporting network is configured as a closed enclave or a segregated and access-controlled sub-enclave having appropriate boundary protection between it and the local general business LAN or external WAN.
- In the event the CTI application accesses resources outside this enclave and there is the potential of the application being compromised from external sources, the supporting network is configured to provide separate voice and data zones and maintains separation of voice and data traffic per the VoIP STIG if technically feasible (i.e., such separation does not break the CTI application or there is another compelling reason).
- The supporting network enclave and boundary protection is configured in substantial compliance with the Enclave, Network Infrastructure, and VoIP STIGs.
- The CTI application/enclave (e.g., a Call Center application) is supported by a dedicated VoIP controller.

VoIP servers are mission critical to the operation of the Voice Video system. Dedicating these critical servers to their task is one of the key steps in securing the Voice Video environment. Permitting critical servers to run non-critical applications can provide a means or a path whereby the server or the critical applications can be compromised. Additionally, running non-critical applications not required for the operations or not related to the primary purpose of the server can degrade the performance of the server and thereby the reliability of the service provided. By not permitting non-critical applications to run on these servers, the server is made more secure. Therefore, the securing of these voice processing and signaling platforms, to include their installed applications, is vital in protecting the VoIP environment from malicious attack.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

Voice Video system services are critical to the effective operation of a business or office or in support or control of a DoD mission. We rely on these services being available in an emergency situation, such as a security breach or life safety event. The ability to place calls to emergency services must be maintained. While the DoD voice and data networks are designed to be extremely reliable, so that continuity of operations (COOP) is supported, there is the potential that Voice Video endpoints could lose availability to communicate with the enclave session manager or multifunction soft switch (MFSS). Natural disasters or damage to network connections or pathways do happen.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

IEEE 802.1x is a protocol used to control access to LAN services via a network access switchport or wireless access point that requires a device or user to authenticate to the network element and become authorized by the authentication server before accessing the network. This standard is used to activate the network access switchport limiting traffic to a specific VLAN or install traffic filters. Implementing 802.1x port security on each access switchport denies all other MAC users, which eliminates the security risk of additional users attaching to a switch to bypass authentication.

When 802.1x is not implemented, MAC-based port security may be implemented by limiting the number of devices that can connect from an endpoint to a network access switch port. Allowing too many MAC addresses on a switch port could allow a hub or switch to be inserted into the voice VLAN port or PC port on a Voice Video endpoint, which allows additional unauthorized devices or workstations to be connected.

Voice video endpoints in the workspace where installed are provisioned with enough LAN drops to support the number of devices to be used in the workspace. This also requires that each LAN drop that is to be used must be connected to a network access switch port. The best practice is to limit the devices permitted to connect to any given LAN drop/switch port combination to one. The two methods to do this are static mapping and MAC-based port security. Static mapping the MAC address of a preauthorized device into the configuration of the network access switch port requires manual configuration.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

Voice video traffic must be isolated from data traffic using separate physical LANs or VLANs. VLAN technology is an effective method for grouping users into workgroups to share a specific network address space and broadcast domain regardless of their physical location on the network. Hosts within the same VLAN communicate with other hosts in the same VLAN. To communicate with other VLANs, traffic must be routed at Layer 3. VLANs can offer significant benefits in a multi-service network by providing a convenient way of isolating Voice Video equipment and traffic from the data traffic. When VLANs are deployed, excessive broadcast and multicast packets present in the normal data traffic will not disrupt Voice Video services. As with data networks, Voice Video equipment and endpoints should be logically grouped using multiple VLANs so that Voice Video endpoints share their VLANs only with other Voice Video endpoints.

      <fixtext fixref="F-VVSP-01-000153_fix">Document in each Voice Video SSP the Voice Video VLAN design for the supporting LAN, providing segmentation of Voice Video services from all other services on the LAN and between Voice Video components.

Design the Voice Video system and the supporting LAN to use multiple VLAN/subnets to segregate the Voice Video core equipment, endpoints, and services from all other hosts and services (including data, management, and other Voice Video systems) running on the LAN.

VLANs and subnets will be provided and equipment separated for devices that are implemented in the system, as follows:

- Hardware Endpoints: Multiple VLANs generally in parallel with data VLANs, the number of which is dependent on the size of the LAN and as required for the reduction of broadcast domains per good LAN design. For small networks there will be a minimum of one.
- Soft client endpoints: Multiple VLANs generally in parallel with data VLANs. Voice and data traffic may coexist on the data VLAN when leaving the workstation. The soft client must tag its signaling and media traffic with the proper DSCP. The LAN access switch port must route the soft client traffic to the Voice Video VLAN.
- Voice Video system core equipment containing the session manager, endpoint configuration server, and other support servers used.
- MG to the DSN and PSTN.
- SG to the DSN.
- SBC to the DoD WAN.
- Voicemail and Unified Messaging Servers: These may need to be accessible from both the voice and data VLANs.

The VLAN/subnets and associated ACLs must be configured for elements in the Voice Video system. The VLAN/ACL design may change depending on the location and physical makeup of the Voice Video core equipment. For example, when an MG and SG reside on the same platform and both use the same Ethernet LAN connections, separate VLANs are not needed for the MG and SG, but the ACL protecting them may need to be adjusted accordingly.

NOTE: The Voice Video system core VLANs may be replaced by direct connections so the ACLs may be implemented on the physical interface to the device. This requires that such direct physical connections be given a discrete subnet.</fixtext>

When the current Voice Video system configuration cannot be determined, it is difficult to apply security policies effectively. Security is particularly important for VoIP technologies attached to the enclave network because these systems increase the potential for eavesdropping and other unauthorized access to network resources. Accurate network documentation is critical to maintaining the network and understanding its security posture, threats, and vulnerabilities. When subscribing to unclassified or classified DISN Voice Services or connecting to the DISN WAN for Voice Video transport, the enclave must update the SSP documentation.

DISN Voice Service provides highly available and reliable communications voice and video service on a worldwide scale, supporting mission-critical decision-making users through the DISN Voice Precedence service. Voice Video communications are not always interoperable between different vendors' systems or the various VoIP services available. Some calls in the DISN Voice Precedence service must be completed at the expense of lower-priority or routine calls. DISA has worked to overcome these issues by working with the many vendors that provide telecommunications equipment to the DoD to develop a highly available, reliable, and interoperable IP-based assured service Voice Video communications network to meet these needs. DoD policy dictates that DISN services be used as the first choice for DoD components to fulfill their long-haul and dialup communications needs.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

        <check-content>Review each organizational Voice Video SSP. Confirm the Voice Video system must document the subscription to or integration with the DISN Voice Service at the appropriate classification level.

When the Voice Video system within the enclave connects to the DISN WAN for transport between enclaves and the system provides assured service communications between enclaves to any level of DISN Voice Precedence user, the system must integrate with the DISN Voice Service on the appropriately classified DISN IP WAN service (i.e., DISN Voice Services over NIPRNet, VoSIP over SIPRNet, etc.). An exception is granted for enclave that is part of an intranet if the intranet as a whole is subscribed to the appropriate DISN Voice Service. An exception is also granted for private Voice Video communication systems implemented for a small community of interest to fulfill a validated mission requirement. In this case, the system is essentially an intercom even though it might span enclave boundaries and the DISN.

If the Voice Video system SSP does not document the subscription to or integration with the DISN Voice Service at the appropriate classification level, this is a finding.

If the Voice Video system within the enclave is integrated with a service-level intranet or implemented as a private communications system for a small community of interest to fulfill a validated mission requirement, this is not a finding.</check-content>

Because vendors did not have interoperability, lacked end-to-end encryption, and did not provide assured service in support of Command and Control (C2) communications, VVoIP traffic originally was restricted to the local enclave. The DSN PMO, DISA Engineering, and other groups have defined network and Voice Video system requirements for DISN Voice Services. Voice Video systems use signaling protocols to set up and manage the communications session and the media transfer protocols carrying the communications. Both signaling and media protocols can be compromised when transmitted without encryption. To provide the assured service pre-emption and priority capabilities required for DISN Voice Precedence communications, DISA developed Assured Services (AS) for network infrastructure and AS-SIP. The common method of providing confidentiality and integrity for SIP signaling and providing session authentication is to encrypt it using TLS.

Voice Video systems use signaling protocols to set up and manage the communications session and the media transfer protocols carrying the communications. Both signaling and media protocols can be compromised when transmitted without encryption. To provide the assured service pre-emption and priority capabilities required for DISN Voice Precedence communications, DISA developed Assured Services (AS) for network infrastructure and AS-SIP. The common method of providing confidentiality and integrity for SIP signaling and providing session authentication is to encrypt it using TLS. The encryption algorithm, key strength, and key management processes are denied in the current version of the DoD Unified Capabilities Requirements (UCR) document available from the DISA voice Services PMO.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

      <title>The organizations System Security Plan (SSP) for the Voice Video system must have approval for all commercial Voice Video connections by the DoDIN Waiver Panel, signed by DOD CIO for a permanent alternate connection to the Internet Telephony Service Provider (ITSP).</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;The information security architecture at the individual information system level must be consistent with and complement the more global, organization-wide information security architecture that is integral to and developed as part of the enterprise architecture. The information security architecture includes an architectural description, the placement/allocation of security functionality (including security controls), security-related information for external interfaces, information being exchanged across the interfaces, and the protection mechanisms associated with each interface.

In addition, the security architecture can include other important security-related information, for example, user roles and access privileges assigned to each role; unique security requirements; the types of information processed, stored, and transmitted by the information system; restoration priorities of information and information system services; and any other specific protection needs.

The DoD requires the use of DISN Voice Services as the first choice to meet core communications needs. When additional services for SIP trunks are necessary, an ITSP (for VoIP services) may provide an alternate connection, but this requires approval by the DoDIN Waiver Panel and signature by the DoD CIO. Local ITSP connections provide an Internet pathway into the DISN, placing the DoDIN directly at risk for exploitation. A local ITSP connection can circumnavigate DoD protections of the DISN at its boundaries with the Internet. Using commercial VoIP service from an ISP requires the implementation of a connection path to the Internet. These types of connections must be approved and must meet the requirements for an Internet Access Point (IAP). ITSP connections may provide SIP trunks terminating on a media gateway, which then provides TDM trunks or POTS lines to traditional non-VoIP PBX, key system, or individual end instrument. ITSP VoIP connections terminating in a separate LAN from the enclave's DoD LAN may support a separate VoIP system. This connection type might be used for a small site having a small VoIP system or a few discrete phones dedicated to commercial network calling.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

        <check-content>Review the Voice Video SSP for the system. Confirm the Voice Video system has approval for all commercial Voice Video connections by the DoDIN Waiver Panel, signed by DOD CIO for a permanent alternate connection to the ITSP.

Voice Video system use cases applicable to this requirement:

- Use Case 1: ITSP connections providing direct connection to the enclave's DoD LAN
- Use Case 2: ITSP connections providing a SIP trunk terminating on a media gateway that provides TDM trunks or POTS lines to traditional non-VoIP PBX, key system, or individual end instrument
- Use Case 3: ITSP connections terminating on a separate LAN from the enclave's DoD LAN supporting a separate VoIP system
- Use Case 4: ITSP connections providing service over any approved ISP gateway

If any enclave connects with a commercial VoIP provider (ITSP) and is not approved by the DoDIN Waiver Panel, this is a finding.

If the DOD CIO has not signed for a permanent alternate connection to the ITSP, this is a finding.

NOTE: This connection will be a permanent connection and should be designated or recognized as such in the approval documentation since most approvals of this type are for temporary connections.</check-content>

Connecting to networks of different classifications simultaneously incurs the risk of data from a higher classification being released to a network of a lower classification, referred to as a "spill". It is imperative that networks of differing classification levels or with differing handling caveats not be interconnected at any time. Separation in a multinetwork VC system is maintained by the use of an A/B, A/B/C, or A/B/C/D switch that meets requirements for channel isolation or by manual connection of the CODEC to one network at a time.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

Most CODECs have a built-in IMUX so that multiple ISDN lines can terminate directly on the CODEC. ISDN lines used for VC transport are provided by a traditional telephone switch on an unclassified network. Connecting a classified IP network to an unclassified telephone network through a VC CODEC while in a conference could lead to disclosure of classified information to the unclassified network and unclassified VC endpoints. While this issue might be mitigated by using a Type 1 encryptor between the CODEC and an external IMUX, an SOP would need to be in place that would dictate that the ISDN connection must be established and the Type 1 encryptor synced with the other end BEFORE the CODEC was connected to the classified IP network.

Volatile memory requires power to maintain the stored information. It retains its contents while powered, but when power is interrupted, stored data is immediately lost. Dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) is a type of random-access memory that stores each bit of data in a separate capacitor within an integrated circuit. Since capacitors leak charge, data fades unless the capacitor charge is refreshed periodically. Static random-access memory (SRAM) has a different configuration from DRAM, which allows it to retain data longer when power is no longer applied (data remanence). Powering off the CODEC for 60 seconds is sufficient to discharge the capacitors and erase all data.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

The A/B, A/B/C, or A/B/C/D switch is physically connected to multiple networks having different classification levels. Copper-based switches provide minimal or no electrical isolation due to capacitance between the wires in the switch box and the switch contacts. This can permit information on one network to bleed or leak over to the other network, which can lead to the disclosure of classified information on a classified network to a network of lower classification. This must be prevented. Optical fiber is an insulator, thus it carries no electrical current and generates no electromagnetic field, eliminating the capacitance issue. As such, it provides excellent electrical isolation between the networks to which it connects.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;The information security architecture at the individual information system level must be consistent with and complement the more global, organization-wide information security architecture that is integral to and developed as part of the enterprise architecture. The information security architecture includes an architectural description, the placement/allocation of security functionality (including security controls), security-related information for external interfaces, information being exchanged across the interfaces, and the protection mechanisms associated with each interface.

In addition, the security architecture can include other important security-related information, for example, user roles and access privileges assigned to each role; unique security requirements; the types of information processed, stored, and transmitted by the information system; restoration priorities of information and information system services; and any other specific protection needs.

Connecting the CODEC to a network while it is being reconfigured could lead to the disclosure of sensitive configuration information for a network having a higher classification level to a network having a lower classification level. Ideally, the CODEC will be disconnected from any network while it is being reconfigured. However, the requirement can be met by using a procedure that purges the configuration for the currently connected network, power cycling the CODEC as required (for a minimum of 60 seconds per VVSP-01-000165) as the CODEC is switched to the next network, and then reconfiguring the CODEC for the next session.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

Common Criteria provides assurance that the process of specification, implementation, and evaluation of a computer security product has been conducted in a rigorous, standard, and repeatable manner at a level that is commensurate with the target environment for use. The Defense Security/Cybersecurity Authorization Working Group (DSAWG) mandated that the A/B, A/B/C, or A/B/C/D switches used in VC systems implementing a single CODEC supporting conferences on multiple networks having different classification levels, where these networks are simultaneously and permanently connected to these networks, must receive NIAP approval in accordance with CNSSP #11. This was primarily due to the potential interconnection of separate networks designated as National Security Systems through the switch. This was a prerequisite to their approval of the multinetwork VC system architecture. Therefore, the A/B, A/B/C, or A/B/C/D switch must be satisfactorily evaluated and validated in accordance with the provisions of the NIAP Common Criteria Evaluation and Validation Scheme.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

If a VC system is implemented using multiple CODECs, each connected to a network having a different classification level, along with an A/V switcher, a potential path exists through the CODECs and A/V switcher that could permit classified information to be exposed/released from one classified network to a network having a lower classification. Minimally, powering off the CODEC will provide a level of isolation that will prevent active passage of data. The above solution could still provide an electrical leakage path between the networks whereby classified information could leak onto another network.

To improve on the electrical isolation between networks and as an alternative to powering off the CODECs, an optical link using fiber optic to Ethernet media adaptors/converters/modems between the CODEC and each of the networks it serves could be implemented. In this case, the fiber optic media adaptors would be powered in a mutually exclusive manner.

Mutually exclusive power means that only one CODEC or fiber optic adaptor can be powered at a time. Turning on one CODEC or fiber optic adaptor turns off power for all others.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

Information leakage is the intentional or unintentional release of information to an untrusted environment from electromagnetic signals emanations. Security categories or classifications of information systems (with respect to confidentiality) and organizational security policies guide the selection of security controls employed to protect systems against information leakage due to electromagnetic signals emanations. The Committee on National Security Systems Advisory Memorandum (CNSSAM) TEMPEST/01-13, RED/BLACK Installation Guidance, provides criteria for the installation of electronic equipment, cabling, and facility support for the processing of secure information. The TEMPEST/01-13 requires the facility housing the secure VC equipment (i.e., the secure conference room) must meet the TEMPEST requirements for such rooms.

Verify the architecture and configuration of a permanent, semi-permanent, or fixed tactical LAN supporting IP-based Voice Video communications is adequate to protect the Voice Video services and infrastructure. Verify the tactical networks are configured as stringently as a strategic LAN supporting Voice Video services.

Determine if the tactical LAN is supporting a fixed or generally non-moving base, making it a fixed tactical LAN. If the fixed tactical network supports IP-based Voice Video communications, determine if it is configured per the requirements for a strategic LAN by inspecting network diagrams.

If the deployed tactical network is relatively permanent compared to a small highly mobile unit and the LAN is not configured as a strategic LAN for the support of IP-based Voice Video, this is a finding.

NOTE: The factors determining whether a deployed tactical Voice Video system is subject to this requirement are varied. In general, all Voice Video systems should be configured the same and so that the service and supporting infrastructure is protected. It is recognized that a small system operated out of a transit case in a tent, CONEX box, or a truck is highly mobile as opposed to a fixed installation in a building. While initially such a system can support a few users and remain highly mobile, as the number of users increases, the deployment becomes semi-permanent, or fixed (not highly mobile). Initial deployments may include as little as a half-dozen workstations or as many as 50. Once the initial deployment is in place, the network may grow and become relatively permanent as would be the case for a rear command or logistics center. Small deployable packages that are designed to be initially deployed with a small footprint supporting or using PC soft-phones, which are then to be the basis of a larger network, must be configured, or be configurable, to support the separate VoIP and data zones as well as hardware-based instruments and admission control for C2 communications as the deployed network and supported systems grow. The network will also include soft-phone protection zones as required in a strategic network if soft-phones are permitted to be used beyond the initial deployment.</check-content>

The information security architecture includes an architectural description, the placement/allocation of security functionality (including security controls), security-related information for external interfaces, information being exchanged across the interfaces, and the protection mechanisms associated with each interface. 

Voice Video systems developed and fielded at sites must be compatible and comparable to all DoD implementations. The network supporting a tactical Voice Video communications system must implement security as stringently as fixed strategic systems. The defined Voice Video architecture serves to segregate and hide the Voice Video communications and infrastructure (to the greatest extent possible on a converged LAN) from the data workstation users and associated platforms. Tactical deployments primarily support Command and Control (C2) mission-critical communications.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

        <check-content>If cybersecurity configuration measures are reduced for highly mobile tactical networks (e.g., initial deployment packages) supporting hardware or Unified Capabilities (UC) soft client Voice Video communications, this is applicable.

Review each Voice Video system security plan (SSP). Confirm with the ISSO that a benefit-to-risk analysis for reduced Voice Video cybersecurity configuration measures in highly mobile tactical LANs and systems supporting Voice Video communications is performed, documented, and approved in the Voice Video SSP. Deployable packages for highly mobile tactical networks may only support UC soft client Voice Video communications applications, which may not require separate VLANs for voice and data since all traffic will be in the data VLAN.

If the Voice Video SSP does not contain a documented benefit-to-risk analysis for reduced Voice Video cybersecurity configuration measures in highly mobile tactical LANs and systems supporting Voice Video communications, this is a finding.</check-content>

      <title>The organization must document and implement the DISN Voice Precedence for mission-critical communications processes with consideration for Voice Video system security and the resulting risk to organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Information protection needs are technology-independent, required capabilities to counter threats to organizations, individuals, or the Nation through the compromise of information (i.e., loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability). Information protection needs are derived from the mission/business needs defined by the organization, the mission/business processes selected to meet the stated needs, and the organizational risk management strategy. Information protection needs determine the required security controls for the organization and the associated information systems supporting the mission/business processes.

Inherent in defining an organizations information protection needs is an understanding of the level of adverse impact that could result if a compromise of information occurs. The security categorization process is used to make such potential impact determinations. Mission/business process definitions and associated information protection requirements are documented by the organization in accordance with organizational policy and procedure.

One of the primary missions of Voice Video systems is the DISN Voice Precedence for mission-critical decision-maker communications, especially during times of crisis. A primary business function includes fire and emergency services (FES) processes. These, along with other mission/business functions, must be documented in the System Security Plan (SSP).&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

These users require hardened network infrastructure and support, assured services, and high availability to meet organizational obligations and responsibilities.

DISN Voice Precedence user categories:

- Flash/Flash Override: Highest level of assured service; requires 99.999 percent uptime with 8 hours uninterruptible power supply (UPS)
- Immediate/Priority: Second-highest level of assured service; requires 99.997 percent uptime with two hours of UPS
- Routine: Lowest level of assured service; requires 99.9 percent uptime with optional UPS
- Non-Mission Critical: Does not require assured service; may be denied features or capabilities during times of crisis

      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Information protection needs are technology-independent, required capabilities to counter threats to organizations, individuals, or the Nation through the compromise of information (i.e., loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability). Information protection needs are derived from the mission/business needs defined by the organization, the mission/business processes selected to meet the stated needs, and the organizational risk management strategy. Information protection needs determine the required security controls for the organization and the associated information systems supporting the mission/business processes.

Inherent in defining an organizations information protection needs is an understanding of the level of adverse impact that could result if a compromise of information occurs. The security categorization process is used to make such potential impact determinations.

One of the primary missions of Voice Video systems is the DISN Voice Precedence for mission-critical decision-maker communications, especially during times of crisis.

If an emergency services number is not designated to access the PSAP, whether internal to the local site or to another local agency or municipality, this is a finding.

If calls to the PSAP are not treated as a priority call in a non-blocking manner, this is a finding.

NOTE: In the event the FES calls are routed to a public entity, the call must route to an internal emergency number in parallel with the external call. Both calls should have the same priority. The site must be aware of the emergency and assist the FES responders in reaching the location of the caller. FES calls may be routed to an internal on-site FES answering point providing the site maintains robust local police, fire, and medical services so these can replace public services. In the event a public FES answering point is the primary answering point for the site, calls must be routed to it directly and not relayed via a local emergency answering point. A second call from the local emergency answering point should not be required to obtain emergency services from the public FES answering point unless the site maintains full and comparable police, fire, and medical services and its answering point is the primary. In the event a local private answering point is the primary answering point, and if this private answering point is not fully staffed on a 24/7 basis, the telephone system must route FES calls to the public answering point when the local answering point is not fully staffed, for example, outside the normal working hours of the site.</check-content>

      <title>The organization must review Voice Video training plans for consistency with the organizational risk management strategy and organization-wide priorities for risk response actions.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Organizations must provide oversight for the security testing, training, and monitoring activities conducted organization-wide and ensure that those activities are coordinated. Often organizations coordinate and consolidate the testing activities that are routinely conducted as part of ongoing organizational assessments supporting a variety of security controls. Security training activities, while typically focused on individual information systems and specific roles, also necessitate coordination across all organizational elements. 

For Voice Video systems, much of the risk is mitigated through user education. Users must understand their role in operating Voice Video systems with security in mind. Further, users must be trained that these systems are necessary for communications at multiple classification levels, often within the same environment. A thorough awareness of the mission/business function each system performs is essential. A comprehensive training plan provides a framework for ensuring users are informed all relevant areas.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

      <title>The organization must require that providers of external Voice Video system services employ security controls defined by CNSSI 1253 in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;External information system services are services that are implemented outside of the authorization boundaries of organizational information systems. This includes services that are used by, but not a part of, organizational information systems. FISMA and OMB policy require that organizations using external service providers that are processing, storing, or transmitting federal information or operating information systems on behalf of the federal government ensure that such providers meet the same security requirements that federal agencies are required to meet.

For services external to organizations, a chain of trust requires that organizations establish and retain a level of confidence that each participating provider in the potentially complex consumer-provider relationship provides adequate protection for the services rendered. The extent and nature of this chain of trust varies based on the relationships between organizations and the external providers. Organizations document the basis for trust relationships so the relationships can be monitored over time. External information system services documentation includes government, service providers, end user security roles and responsibilities, and service-level agreements. Service-level agreements define expectations of performance for security controls, describe measurable outcomes, and identify remedies and response requirements for identified instances of noncompliance.&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>

      <title>The organization must monitor the Voice Video system to detect unauthorized local connections.</title>
      <description>&lt;VulnDiscussion&gt;Information system monitoring includes external and internal monitoring. External monitoring includes the observation of events occurring at the information system boundary (i.e., part of perimeter defense and boundary protection). Internal monitoring includes the observation of events occurring within the information system. Organizations can monitor information systems, for example, by observing audit activities in real time or by observing other system aspects such as access patterns, characteristics of access, and other actions. The monitoring objectives may guide determination of the events.

Information system monitoring capability is achieved through a variety of tools and techniques (e.g., intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, malicious code protection software, scanning tools, audit record monitoring software, network monitoring software). A network connection is any connection with a device that communicates through a network (e.g., local area network, Internet).&lt;/VulnDiscussion&gt;&lt;FalsePositives&gt;&lt;/FalsePositives&gt;&lt;FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;/FalseNegatives&gt;&lt;Documentable&gt;false&lt;/Documentable&gt;&lt;Mitigations&gt;&lt;/Mitigations&gt;&lt;SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;/SecurityOverrideGuidance&gt;&lt;PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;/PotentialImpacts&gt;&lt;ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;/ThirdPartyTools&gt;&lt;MitigationControl&gt;&lt;/MitigationControl&gt;&lt;Responsibility&gt;&lt;/Responsibility&gt;&lt;IAControls&gt;&lt;/IAControls&gt;</description>
